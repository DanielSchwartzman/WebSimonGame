# Simon Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic **Simon Game**, where players test and improve their memory skills by repeating an ever-growing sequence of colors.  
The game challenges the user by adding a new step to the sequence with each successful round. The goal is to memorize and reproduce the sequence for as long as possible!

## How to Play
1. Press any button to begin.
2. Watch the sequence of flashes.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The game continues with an added step each round.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends and you can restart.
